### user.js
Firefox uses the `user.js` to make changes to browser functionality across updates; it overrides any changes made using `about:config` and does not exist by default.

See: http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file

### Template
This is a template and should be used as such; I've included items that I think are important and often have to use another browser for banking or restart Firefox with everything disabled.
Your mileage may vary.

## Location

An accurate way to find where to place the `user.js` is to type `about:profiles` in your URL bar. The profile in use will be listed under the heading:

`This is the profile in use and it cannot be deleted.`

Using your favorite method, navigate to that directory and create your user.js file there.
