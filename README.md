### user.js
Firefox uses the `user.js` to make changes to browser functionality across updates; it overrides any changes made using `about:config` and does not exist by default.

See: http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file

### Template
This is a template and should be used as such; I've included items that I think are important and often have to use another browser for banking or restart Firefox with everything disabled.
Your mileage may vary.

### Acknowledgements
See a list of the main sources in the `user.js` file itself; too many others to mention outside of that.
